# Spotify Playlist Management Tool

Abusing Yeoman to make a crappy little command line tool to manage Spotify playlists.
Only allows you to copy parts of existing playlists into another new or existing playlist.

Requires Spotify developer credentials `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` be defined in your environment.
